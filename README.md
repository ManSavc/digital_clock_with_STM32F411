It's a project to show how working RTC and how change the start value of it.
First of all we create cubeIDE new project, set RTC and GPIO (input and pull down)
in "Pinuot and configuration".

![gpio](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e52b96b-61df-430d-b958-00b40fd694d3)

Then, we must to see that frequency of RTC will be 32768 Hz. In this frequency is bigest acuracy.

After we do this, push code and see the result.
